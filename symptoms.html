          <h3>Symptoms</a></h3>

           <font size="3">
           <p>
            ASD is a learning disorder that involves difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech sounds and learning how they relate to letters and words (decoding). Also called reading disability, ASD affects areas of the brain that process language.
            People with ASD have normal intelligence and usually have normal vision. Most children with ASD can succeed in school with tutoring or a specialized education program. Emotional support also plays an important role.
            Though there's no cure for ASD, early assessment and intervention result in the best outcome. Sometimes ASD goes undiagnosed for years and isn't recognized until adulthood, but it's never too late to seek help.
           The signs and symptoms of ASD differ from person to person. Each individual with the condition will have a unique pattern of strengths and weaknesses.
           Some of the most common signs of ASD are outlined below.
           </p></br>
           <h3>Preschool children</h3>
           <p>In some cases, it's possible to detect symptoms of ASD before a child starts school. Symptoms can include:
             <li>Delayed speech development compared with other children of the same age (although this can have many different causes)</li>
             <li>Speech problems, such as not being able to pronounce long words properly and "jumbling" up phrases – for example, saying "hecilopter" instead of "helicopter", or "beddy tear" instead of "teddy bear"</li>
             <li>Problems expressing themselves using spoken language, such as being unable to remember the right word to use, or putting together sentences incorrectly</li>
             <li>Little understanding or appreciation of rhyming words, such as "the cat sat on the mat", or nursery rhymes</li>
             <li>Difficulty with, or little interest in, learning letters of the alphabet</li>
           </p></br>

           <h3>School children</h3>
           <p>Symptoms of ASD usually become more obvious when children start school and begin to focus more on learning how to read and write.

             Symptoms of ASD in children aged 5-12 include:

             <li>Problems learning the names and sounds of letters</li>
             <li>Spelling that is unpredictable and inconsistent</li>
             <li>Putting letters and figures the wrong way round – such as writing "6" instead "9", or "b" instead of "d"</li>
             <li>Confusing the order of letters in words</li>
             <li>Reading slowly or making errors when reading aloud</li>
             <li>Visual disturbances when reading – for example, a child may describe letters and words as seeming to move around or appear blurred</li>
             <li>Answering questions well orally, but having difficulty writing down the answer</li>
             <li>Difficulty carrying out a sequence of directions</li>
             <li>Struggling to learn sequences, such as days of the week or the alphabet</li>
             <li>Slow writing speed</li>
             <li>Poor handwriting</li>
             <li>Problems copying written language, and taking longer than normal to complete written work</li>
             <li>Poor phonological awareness and "word attack" skills (see below)</li>

           </br><b>Phonological awareness</b></br>
             Phonological awareness is the ability to recognise that words are made up of smaller units of sound (phonemes) and that changing and manipulating phonemes can create new words and meanings.
             A child with poor phonological awareness may not be able to correctly answer these questions:
             <li>What sounds do you think make up the word "hot", and are these different from the sounds that make up the word "hat"?</li>
             <li>What word would you have if you changed the "p" sound in 'pot' to an "h" sound?</li>
             <li>How many words can you think of that rhyme with the word "cat"?</li></br>

             <b>Word attack skills</b></br>
             Young children with ASD can also have problems with "word attack" skills. This is the ability to make sense of unfamiliar words by looking for smaller words or collections of letters that a child has previously learnt.
             For example, a child with good word attack skills may read the word "sunbathing" for the first time and gain a sense of the meaning of the word by breaking it down into "sun", "bath", and "ing".
           </p></br>

           <h3>Getting Help</h3>
           <p>If you're concerned about your child's progress with reading and writing, first talk to their school teacher.
             If you or your child's teacher has an ongoing concern, take your child to visit a GP so they can check for signs of any underlying health issues, such as hearing or vision problems, that could be affecting their ability to learn.
             If your child doesn't have any obvious underlying health problems to explain their learning difficulties, different teaching methods may need to be tried, or you may want to request an assessment to identify any special needs they may have.
             If you're an adult and think you may have ASD, you may want to arrange a ASD assessment through your local ASD association.
           </p></br>

           <h3>Associated problems</h3>
           <p>Some people with ASD also have other problems not directly connected to reading or writing, such as:
            <li> Difficulties with numbers (dyscalculia)</li>
            <li> Poor short-term memory</li>
            <li> Problems concentrating and a short attention span, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</li>
            <li> Poor organisation and time-management</li>
            <li> Physical coordination problems (developmental coordination disorder, also called DCD or dyspraxia) </li>
           </p></br>
