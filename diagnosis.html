                 <h3>Diagnosis</a></h3>

             <font size="3">
             <p>
               The earlier a child with Autism is diagnosed, the more effective educational interventions are likely to be.
               However, identifying ASD in young children can be difficult for both parents and teachers, because the signs and symptoms are not always obvious.
               If you're worried about your child
               If you're concerned about your child’s progress with reading and writing, first talk to their teacher. You may also want to meet with other staff in the school.
               If there's an ongoing concern, take your child to visit a GP. It may be that your child has health problems that are affecting their ability to read or write. For example, they may have:
               <li>Vision problems, such as short-sightedness or a squint</li>
               <li>Hearing problems, as the result of a condition such as glue ear</li>
               <li>Other conditions, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</li>
               If your child doesn't have any obvious underlying health problems to explain their learning difficulties, it may be that they're not responding very well to the teaching method, and a different approach may be needed.
               Read about managing ASD for more information about educational interventions that may help.
             </p>
             <h3>Managing ASD</a></h3>
             <p>While ASD is a lifelong problem, there's a range of specialist educational interventions that can help children with their reading and writing.
              These interventions are generally most effective if they're started at a young age.
              The type and extent of intervention necessary will depend on the severity of your child's difficulties. A specific action plan for your child may be drawn up and implemented by their school.
              Most mainstream schools should be able to offer suitable interventions for your child, although a small number of children may benefit from attending a specialist school.
             </p>
             <h3>How you can help your child</h3>
            Parents also play a significant role in improving their child's confidence, so it's important to encourage and support your child as they learn. As a parent, you might be unsure about the best way to help your child. You may find the following advice useful:

             <li>Read to your child – this will improve their vocabulary and listening skills, and it will also encourage their interest in books.</li>
             <li>Share reading – both read some of the book and then discuss what's happening, or what might happen.</li>
             <li>"Overlearning" – you may get bored of reading your child's favourite book over and over, but repetition will reinforce their understanding and means they will become familiar with the text.</li>
             <li>Silent reading – children also need the chance to read alone to encourage their independence and fluency.</li>
             <li>Make reading fun – reading should be a pleasure, not a chore. Use books about subjects your child is interested in, and ensure that reading takes place in a relaxed and comfortable environment.</li>
